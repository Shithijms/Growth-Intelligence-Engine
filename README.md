#  Growth Intelligence Engine — DataVex

An autonomous, keyword-driven growth system that converts real-world internet signals into high-authority, publish-ready content assets for **DataVex**.

This project operationalizes **information arbitrage**:
Find emerging technical signals → select a strategic angle → generate multi-platform content → refine through critique loops → ship authority.

---

# 🧠 System Overview

The engine follows a structured editorial pipeline:

## 1️⃣ Input Layer
- **Keyword** (provided by organizer)
- **DataVex Context Memory**
- **Brand Voice Guide**

These define constraints, tone, and positioning.

---

## 2️⃣ External Signal Discovery
The system:
- Searches for a real article, research paper, funding announcement, outage, or competitor move
- Selects a relevant signal tied to the keyword
- Filters noise
- Outputs a selected signal

Goal: Identify leverage, not trends.

---

## 3️⃣ Strategy Brief Generator (Editorial Judgment Layer)

Before writing content, the system produces a **Strategy Brief**:

Includes:
- Signal summary
- Chosen strategic angle
- Rejected angles (with reasoning)
- Platform distribution plan
- Core positioning thesis

This ensures thinking precedes writing.

---

# ✍️ Content Generation Layer

The engine splits into two tracks:

---

## 🟢 Long Form (Blog)

**Flow:**
Angle + Signal → Blog Generator → Critique Agent → Refinement Loop → Final Blog

Outputs:
- 800–1200 word SEO-structured blog post
- Technical deep dive
- Problem-first positioning
- Data-backed narrative

The critique agent improves:
- Hook strength
- Clarity
- Authority tone
- Differentiation
- Logical structure

---

## 🟣 Short Form (LinkedIn + Twitter/X)

**Flow:**
Angle + Signal → Short-Form Generator → Short-Form Critique → Refinement → Final Assets

Outputs:
- LinkedIn Post (200–300 words)
- Twitter/X Thread (5–8 tweets)

Optimized for:
- Platform-native structure
- Hook density
- Engagement triggers
- Shareability

---

# 🔁 Critique Loop (Core Differentiator)

Each content asset follows:

Draft 1  
→ Critique 1  
→ Draft 2  
→ Critique 2  
→ Final Version  

Critiques address:
- Generic hooks
- Sales-heavy tone
- Weak differentiation
- Lack of data
- Platform mismatch
- Structural inefficiencies

An evolution log is generated for transparency.

---

# 📦 Final Outputs

- ✅ Strategy Brief
- ✅ Final Blog Post
- ✅ Final LinkedIn Post
- ✅ Final Twitter Thread
- ✅ Critique Trace (Draft Evolution)
- ✅ UI Dashboard View (aggregated outputs)
