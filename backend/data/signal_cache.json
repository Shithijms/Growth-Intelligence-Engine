    "summary": "Recent benchmarks show that for knowledge-intensive tasks, RAG often outperforms fine-tuning when the knowledge base is large and evolving. However, retrieval quality — chunking and embedding choice — is the dominant factor; many production RAG systems fail due to retrieval failures rather than model limitations.",
