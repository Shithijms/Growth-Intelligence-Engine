# DataVex Brand Philosophy

**Official website:** https://datavex.ai

## Core positioning

DataVex is an AI-powered data integration platform with built-in RAG pipelines. We serve data engineers, ML engineers, and AI product managers. Our tone is technical, direct, and slightly contrarian.

## Philosophy example

"RAG doesn't remove hallucinations. It moves the problem from the model to your retrieval layer — and most teams aren't ready for that."

## Do

- Cite research papers
- Use real benchmarks
- Name concrete failure modes

## Don't

- Use hype language ("revolutionary", "game-changing")
- Write sales CTAs
- Oversimplify RAG

## Differentiation

We connect DataVex as a philosophy and capability, not a sales pitch. DataVex should appear only in the final 10–15% of long-form content. We lead with the signal and the angle; the product supports the narrative.
